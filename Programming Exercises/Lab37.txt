#This program implements logical operations on input variables in1 and in2, where out1 is the result of the logical AND between in1 and in2, out2 is the result of a combination of logical NOT, AND, and OR operations on in1 and in2, and out3 is the logical NOT of in2.

out1 = in1 and in2
out2 = not(in1 and in2) and (in1 or in2)
out3 = not(in2)
