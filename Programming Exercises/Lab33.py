#This program implements an image processing task using NumPy and Matplotlib, where it reads an input image file, extracts the lower-left quarter of the image, displays it, and saves the resulting image to an output file specified by the user.

import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

inF = input("Enter image file name: ")
outF = input("Enter output file: ")

img = plt.imread(inF) #Read in image from inF
height = img.shape[0] #Get height
width = img.shape[1] #Get width
# 5 Make a new image thatâ€™s half the height and half the width.
img2 = img[height//2:, :width//2] #Crop to lower left corner
# Display the new image.
plt.imshow(img2) # Load our new image into pyplot
plt.show() # Show the image
plt.imsave(outF, img2)
